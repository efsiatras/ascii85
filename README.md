# Ascii85 Encoder and Decoder
Encodes and decodes Ascii85. 

### What is Ascii85?
**Ascii85**, also called **Base85**, is a form of binary-to-text encoding developed by Paul E. Rutter. 

It uses five ASCII characters to represent four bytes of binary data (making the encoded size 1‚ÅÑ4 larger than the original, assuming eight bits per ASCII character).

### Compilation
`$ gcc encasc85.c -o encasc85`

`$ gcc decasc85.c -o decasc85`
### Usage
For encoding example.txt:

`$ ./encasc85 < example.txt`

For decoding example.txt:

`$ ./decasc85 < example.txt`
